# Micro_facial_expression using 3D CNN.
The objective is to create a deep learning model that can reliably categorize face microexpressions into discrete emotional groups. Facial expressions are so fleeting that they are usually invisible to the naked eye, but they convey a person's true feelings, even when they are purposefully attempting to convey a different image.Seven emotional categories are included in our labeled dataset: "surprise," "fear," "neutral," "sadness," "disgust," "happiness," and "anger."
